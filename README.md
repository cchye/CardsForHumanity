# CardsForHumanity
In a world where information is quickly accessed and easy to come by, it's also become increasingly easy to become misinformed. From social constructs regarding sex, gender, and race to health issues, people have begun to trust any site that seems to know what it is talking about. Well, we have decided to put the top issues we have seen in these various issues in one place and to debunk all these common misconceptions. We have done thorough research and created a deck of cards for each topic, and when you hover over a card, you can learn what the reality of the matter is. We hope you have some fun and learn from our Cards for Humanity!
